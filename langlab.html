The Phonetics &amp; Interactive communication skills  laboratories help students to develop English skills, enriching their  interpersonal skills, enhancing their confidence levels and marginalizing their  first language influence. In the language laboratory, they provide training  in communication and interpersonal skills, accent neutralization. Keeping in  their pre-employment needs and career requirements to expand personal growth  and opportunity, they are given training and practice. The students develop  their soft skills, presentation skills and build up confidence and enhance  their performance at Placement Interviews, Group Discussions and other  recruitments. It also helps students to participate actively and effectively in  academic discussions, oral presentations, debates, etc.  The course is so designed that students,  especially those who come from vernacular medium and have little exposure to  conversing in English, can proceed to learn it at their own pace and on their  own, with minimum assistance from the instructor. <br />
