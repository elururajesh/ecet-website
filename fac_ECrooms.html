<br><Font Size = 4>The College is equipped with e-classrooms with a minimum seating capacity of 250 for all engineering streams to enable students with world class teaching experience via audio-visual teaching methodologies. Our College has introduced an active learning atmosphere though the state of art e-classroom facilities. The students and faculty use computers for regularly scheduled class. This class room is used to develop communication skills, in team based projects, apart from curriculum prescribed course work.

The presence of technology in the classroom is a testimony to access of knowledge and communication tools online at the work place. Faculty can also share their discipline-specific application of technology such as the use of online databases.
